Peru-Trust-Games
================

This is a project intended for eventual publication to IPA's Data Repository. It is from a paper from Dean Karlan on Peru and
trust. 


The current analysis do file is TrustGames_Analysis. The file experimentaleconomics_working.do is an older version of this do-file (and is mostly just a replica).
